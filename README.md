This is a popular game and one way to implement it is using linked lists. In this game one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess the word one letter a time. The word can be the list itself and each node would be each letter of the word. This data structure allows efficient insertion and deletion of nodes, so during the game it's suitable for dynamically managing the word.
